# Contributing to the wiki
You can contribute in multiple ways to the anyonwiki: 
1. Whenever you notice a result that seems strange, you can raise an issue on the [github page](https://github.com/anyonwiki/anyonwiki.github.io) or send an email to gXerXt.verXclXeyen@protonmail.com[^1]. 
2. You can edit individual pages by forking the github repository and editing the pages on your own fork. Once you're happy, create a pull request, and we will review the changes. If you plan to contribute a lot, contact gXerXt.verXclXeyen@protonmail.com[^1]. 

While the wiki is mainly maintained by G. Vercleyen, any contributions are more than welcome. **Note that the anyonwiki does not claim to be error-free!** Use all data at your own risk, and please report any concerns. 

# Citing the wiki
The wiki is built upon many hours of research by various researchers. Several pages contain links to papers at the bottom. If you feel that your paper should be referenced then either raise an issue on github or send an email to gXerXt.verXclXeyen@protonmail.com[^1].

At the moment, we're investigating how we can create a fair DOI for the website that includes its contributors in a fair manner, but this needs some proper brainstorming.
