# Useful software for working with fusion rings, fusion categories, and anyon models.

* [Kac](https://www.nikhef.nl/~t58/Site/Kac.html): Kac is an acronym that stands for “Komputations with Algebras and Currents”. The main purpose of "Kac" is to compute fusion rules for Rational Conformal Field Theories based on affine Lie Algebras and their simple current extensions. This includes most coset CFT’s and their tensor products.
* [Alatc](https://github.com/ardonne/affine-lie-algebra-tensor-category): Mathematica package for calculating the F- and R- symbols from the quantum groups associated with (non-twisted) affine Lie algebras, as well as the associated modular data, both numerically and in exact form.
* [FusionRings.wl](https://github.com/gert-vercleyen/FusionRings): Mathematica package designed to explore and calculate properties of fusion rings in a user friendly manner. It contains an extensive (though not exhaustive) list fusion rings: FusionRingList (or FRL), and many functions for working with fusion rings.
